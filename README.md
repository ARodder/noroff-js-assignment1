# Noroff JavaScript Assignment 1 - Dynamic webpage with vanilla JS
This repository is created to complete the first assignment in the JavaScript-module of Noroff Accelerate. The assignment centers around building a dynamic webpage with basic html,css and vanilla JavaScript.

## Description
By reviewing the given wireframes, and create either a copy or your own design as long as it meets the minimum requirements for the bank, work and laptops

### The bank
Needs to display a bank balance in your currency, which is the amount you have disposable to potentially buy a laptop.\
 You also need to be able to take up a loan by writing the loan amount into a popup prompt. With a max loan amount of twice the bank balance.

### Work
First Work needs to display the amount the user has earned, but not paid out to the bank. \
Then it has a Bank-button to transfer the earned money to the bank, if there is a loan 10% of the pay goes toward paying down the loan. \
There also needs to be a work button which adds 100 of whatever currency you use to the unpaid salary.\
Lastly if there is an unpaid loan a button should be displayed, giving the user the option to put their entire salary to paying down the loan.

### Laptop
Laptop has to parts, one big and one small. The first small one is a way to select the computer you are interested in, and displaying the features of that computer. \
The second bigger part is displaying the currently selected computer, the name, price and the description of that computer and a button to buy that computer. \
The buy button requires a check that the bank balance of the user is high enough.

## Running
